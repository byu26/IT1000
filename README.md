If you enjoy IT as much as I did, I recommend studying abroad! You can see information about the IT Study Abroad I went on [here](https://engineering.missouri.edu/academics/it/study-abroad-it/). Studying abroad is such a great experience for learning and meeting new people. 

[These](https://github.com/byu26/IT1000/tree/master/Ireland%20Photos) are some of my favorite pictures of hundreds I took while on the study abroad.
